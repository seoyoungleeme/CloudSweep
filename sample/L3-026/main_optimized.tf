# =============================================================================
# FINOPS: ec2-transit-gateway-y3bueb - migrate simple same-region VPC-to-VPC
# traffic away from Transit Gateway data processing and onto VPC Peering.
#
# Evidence:
# - main.tf has 1 Transit Gateway and 2 TGW VPC attachments.
# - main.tf also has an existing same-region VPC Peering connection that is
#   marked non-problematic in tags_inventory.json; preserve it.
# - cost_report.json pricing_note: 10TB x $0.02/GB = $200/month TGW data
#   processing. Same-AZ VPC Peering is free for this scenario.
#
# Estimated savings: ~$200/month (~$2,400/year), before any attachment-hour
# savings. Attachment-hour savings are not counted until route/dependency checks
# confirm the TGW can be safely detached.
#
# IMPORTANT CUTOVER ORDER:
# 1. Confirm no transitive routing, centralized inspection, VPN/DX, or
#    multi-account routing depends on the TGW.
# 2. Confirm VPC CIDRs do not overlap and SG/NACL rules allow peering traffic.
# 3. Move routes for the high-volume VPC-to-VPC path to VPC Peering.
# 4. Monitor TGW bytes and application metrics for 7 days.
# 5. Only then remove TGW attachments and the TGW.
# =============================================================================

# PHASE 2 REMOVAL CANDIDATE after the cutover checks above pass.

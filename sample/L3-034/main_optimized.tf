# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# FINOPS: All 10 accounts — consolidated_billing = false → true
#
# Problem: Each account purchases discounts in isolation. Average individual
# RI/SP coverage is 16% (12% RI + 4% SP), while the organization already
# supports enterprise consolidated billing with modeled combined coverage of
# 65% RI + 20% SP. RI/SP purchases in any account cannot benefit other accounts.
#
# Fix: Enroll all 10 accounts in consolidated billing under organization-bg5imo.
# Expected savings: ~$3,000/mo (~$36,000/yr) from RI/SP pooling + volume discounts.
# Savings basis: cost_report.json pricing_note (authoritative) — 20% of $15,000/mo.
#
# PREREQUISITE — before applying:
#   1. Confirm all accounts share the same legal/commercial billing entity.
#   2. Confirm no Billing Conductor or billing transfer isolates charges.
#   3. Confirm RI/SP sharing preferences at the management account level.
#   4. Confirm shared discounts do not break team chargeback agreements.
#   5. Complete tag governance (O5) — Owner and CostCenter required for
#      per-account savings attribution before purchasing new commitments.
#
# OPERATIONAL STEPS (real AWS environment — not Terraform):
#   1. In the management account (organization-bg5imo), go to
#      AWS Organizations → Accounts and verify all 10 accounts are members.
#   2. In Cost Management → Cost and Usage → Savings Plans settings,
#      enable "Savings Plans sharing" for the management account.
#   3. In Cost Management → Reserved Instances, enable "RI sharing" for
#      the management account.
#   4. Apply updated account tags from this file (set Owner + CostCenter
#      from HRIS before applying).
#   5. Monitor Cost Explorer for 30 days to confirm effective savings rate.
